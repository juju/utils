// Package retry provides a framework for retrying actions.
// It does not itself invoke the action to be retried, but
// is intended to be used in a retry loop.
//
// The basic usage is as follows:
//
//	for a := someStrategy.Start(); a.Next(); {
//		try()
//	}
//
// See examples for details of suggested usage.

// and functions are intended to be sufficient for most purposes.
